# TO DO:

split obscure word list into 26, letter by letter.  
look at first letter in each word, and then search in relevant obscure word list.
filter out common words (top 500?) to prevent unnecessary searches.
if the obscure word is matched, get definition from OED and post reddit comment.
if a comment contains two or more obscure words, only post one comment containing all the definitions.
